Hello! My name is Bhuvan S V. I was born in 2001 in India. I am currently a second year physics student in [BITS Pilani, K.K.Birla Goa campus](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/).
 
My primary interest lies in Physics, especially in Quantum Gravity and Cosmology, and am learning stuff to get to it.
I have recently started to delve into the world of Quantum Computing as well(which I though was impossible for quite some time), and mostly build quantum circuits for recreation.
I am also interested in Philosophy, and spend ssome of my free time trying to understand it, most of it in vain.

Here is my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ggHOPIYOLz-vND8aL9dQwPpYIcSTzZsJ/view?usp=sharing) if you wish to look at it (although I must say that this was just to introduce me to LaTeX).

I intend to keep an up-to-date log and a timeline of my interests and my works.
